# The print function has some useful features, note that blanks are inserted
# as separators automatically, but these can be replaced
print("north","south","east","west")

# Also, (not on ref guide) a newline is automatic but can be replaced

# input("question") prints "question" and waits for a response, which is
# returned as a string
years=input("How many years")

# len() returns the length of a list or string
myList=["north","south","east","west"]

print(len(myList), len(myStr))

# min(list) returns the minimum value in a list
# For myList, it returns the alphabetically first element
# The second pairs of lists are set up as temporary objects just to
# demonstrate that strings are just sorted by the 1st digit if numeric
print(min(myList),min([94,41,145]),min(["23","47","114"]))

# These return an error: print(sum(myList)) print(sum(["23","47","114"]))

# We mostly use range() in a for loop  (see section M) but this works

# and round(num,n) returns num rounded to n decimal places

# The next batch of functions cover finding out what type of variable you
# have type(x) and then functions for converting it to a string str(),
# a list list(), an integer int(), or a floating point (decimal) float()
print(str(b), list(myStr), int(b), float(a))

# A Boolean represents either True or False (or 1 or 0)
# bool() converts the parameter to a boolean value
# Pretty much anything other than 0, [], "", False will return True

# The next two functions are for changing to/from UniCode
# chr() returns the string of a Unicode and ord() does the reverse
